- ObjectRenderAPI/ORAPI ( crap✨ ) - **an API that was supposed to render Objects in client**
- SquidGame ( crap✨ ) - **Red light green light but non-functional**
- Pet ( crap✨ ) - **a Pet plugin that was supposed to render pets as objects using ORAPI but it sucks and doesnt work at all**

### !!NOTE!!
- These codes are made by **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and may have bugs but with my tests they where working fine ( not all ). but i wrote that atleast hehe... the api docs for plugin makers is also made by AI. the hard part was debugging it and telling gemini to fix it and it was pain
- If youre just a player and found a server hosted by Plasocket.. **DO NOT JOIN** if youre not sure whats inside.. the client has some functions that are working without any prompt like force loading a tilemap texture which bad guys can use this to crash or even kill your pc for loading a sussy tilemap، and for the world loading.. they can even give a world that can do the same result to the client or pc. check out [API Docs](API.md) to see what you can do and others can do. but a re-created or forked server could have different api or functions to be good or crash your pc/client.
- Imagine paying google to get Gemini 2.5 Pro to get _working_ codes and with 95 times of re-writing it still fails
