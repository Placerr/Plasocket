## Information About Plugins

### !!NOTE!!
- These codes are made by **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and may have problems but with my tests they where working fine. but i wrote that atleast hehe... the api docs for plugin makers is also made by AI. the hard part was debugging it and telling gemini to fix it and it was pain
- If youre just a player and found a server hosted by Plasocket.. **DO NOT JOIN** if youre not sure whats inside.. the client has some functions that are working without any prompt like force loading a tilemap texture which bad guys can use this to crash or even kill your pc for loading a sussy tilemapØŒ and for the world loading.. they can even give a world that can do the same result to the client or pc. check out [API Docs](API.md) to see what you can do and others can do. but a re-created or forked server could have different api or functions to be good or crash your pc/client.
